                           We met at Church. I noticed her the moment she walked in, and I thought to myself &lsquo;Who be this fine girl? (In the middle of service ooo ðŸ˜‚) &rsquo;. 
                           I decided I was going to talk to her after service, but she disappeared immediately after the benediction. This happened for 3 consecutive weeks until one fateful day... (To be continued)

                            They have all been memorable, but we once went to see a &apos;stage&apos; play at Terra 
                            Kulture - turns out it was one of those they had intended the audience 
                            to be a part of it. It was hilarious!

                            We had a flight to catch very early in the morning, and we almost missed our 
                            flight. Everyone had already boarded and we had to run, literally, to catch up. Never seen her run that fast till that moment LOL.
